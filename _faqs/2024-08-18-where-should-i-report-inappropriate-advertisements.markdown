title: Where should I report inappropriate advertisements displayed on your website?
tags: []
 
---

The advertisements displayed on our website getgreenshot.org are not hand-picked by us, we are using Google's advertising platform [Adsense](https://adsense.google.com/), which decides which ads are shown.

Every now and then, we receive reports from people who witnessed inappropriate ads, e.g. containing a button labelled "Download", "Start here" or similar, which then take you to a different website. 
We hate these advertisements (at least) as much as you do and we agree that ads like these are pretty misleading. Whenever we see them we head over and block them.

However, as different users see different advertisements based on many factors, we don't get to see all of them. That's where you can help: please use Google's reporting tools if you see ads you don't like.
 * You can use [Google's form for reporting inappropriate advertisements](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7660847) for anything that you regard misleading or inappropriate.
  This should be the most directy way to get rid of them. The more reports, the better.
 * Google also offers the possibility to quickly send feedback about ads by clicking the X button in the top-right corner of the advertisement, which you can also use if you do not like an ad for any reason.

We highly appreciate any reports of bad advertisement to Google. It helps us as maintainers to get rid of them as quickly as possible, it helps Google to understand what people regard as inappropriate 
and it helps fellow users who won't have to see these ads in the future. Everyone wins, except the questionable advertiser.

Thanks for your help :)
